<p>This Project I chose a similar theme but this time its about my training camp a month out from competition time.</p>
<p>My last visit to California I competed in a Body Building Competition in San Francisco. I started my training 5 months prior but the main part of the story is about the rigorous 4 weeks right before stage time. The dieting, over-sleeping, and physical training is suppose to be difficult but well worth it. That competition I took 3rd place but "I'll be back."</p>
