<p>This story is an expansion from week 1 "My next vacation." I am visiting my brother in Sacramento. My primary purpose for the trip
is to get tattoos because my brother is a artist but, besides getting tattoos we also enjoy working out at the gym. This is what my
project2 story is about, my brother and I working out at the gym in Travis Airforce Base.</p>
